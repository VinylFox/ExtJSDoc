== Ext JS Doc

Ext JS Doc is a ExtJS-style JavaScript comments processor used for building API documentation similar to the documentation bundled with the Ext JS library.

= Building Docs

(if your looking to just build documentation, you only need the ext-doc.jar file and the sample, template and lib folders)

Using Java on the command line, we need to execute the ext-doc.jar file and pass in a few arguments.

* p - The processor XML file (sample\ext.xml)
* s - The source code with your JSDoc comments in it.
* o - The output folder 
* t - The template XML file (template\ext\template.xml)

So for example, the full command line to generate docs might look like this:

 java -jar ext-doc.jar -p sample\ext.xml -s my\source\code\folder -o my\docs -t template\ext\template.xml -verbose
